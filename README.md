# UNDERSTANDING KING COUNTYâ€™S HOUSING MARKET

## Introduction

The project aims to find important insights as we explore the huge world of real estate that will aid in the comprehension of the dynamics of the housing market in King County.
We will walk you through each step of the process of developing and assessing our linear regression model and go over the main factors that affect home values, talk about the issues with linear regression, and use analysis and visualizations to show off our model's ability to predict outcomes.By the end of the presentation, we hope to provide insights that can  be used in similar datasets , in addition to demystifying the complexity of real estate prediction.

### Business Problem
The management of a startup real estate company seeks to understand the key factors influencing housing prices in King County.Their capacity to develop focused actions and activities to support housing affordability and fair access to housing is limited by a lack of data-driven insights.

### The Data

This project uses the King County House Sales dataset, which can be found in  `kc_house_data.csv` in the data folder in this project's GitHub repository. The description of the column names can be found in `column_names.md` in the same folder.

The project aims to use CRISP-DM datascience methodology to fit and select the best regression model that will predict the housing prices.The resultant model will be used by the real estate company to price housing units inorder to attract customers and optimize their sales.
